            <p class="fs-5 text-start" style="width: 90%;height: 75vh;margin: auto;padding: 0 10px;overflow-y: scroll;">My philosophy on teaching in based by 6 principals that I will seek to have in my classroom as a teacher:<br><br>1.Adress all students needs regardless of their differences and capacities.<br><br>2.Develop critical thinking and questioning skills on my students by connecting everything they are learning to real life experiences.<br><br>3.Develop teamwork and respect for others in my students because it is the base of learning how to live in a community.<br><br>4.Make students feel that they are in a safe place and that I am there for them whenever they need, because they know they can trust me.<br><br>5.Develop a culture of error inside my classroom where mistakes are not bad, and always treat students with a growth mindset and high expectations.<br><br>6.Develop independence and agency in my students, make them know that they can make important decisions by themselves outside and inside the classroom.<br><br>To be able to create a classroom in were all these principles are addressed and developed, students must be motivated to go to school, and they must be part of an educational environment where they can grow physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially. Another important aspect is that I must be an ethic teacher, that means giving each student what they deserve and being fair with all of them.<br><br>I believe these are the most important principles because of what I have learned in college and what I have seen in the schools I have been actively participating at. Students in Chile mostly don’t know how to work as a team, or they feel the classroom is not a safe environment in where errors are accepted because we can learn from them and because we are humans. Moreover, they don’t know what to do or how to solve problems if the teacher is not there guiding them or telling them what to do. My objective with these six principles is to change this type of Chilean education and culture by eliminating all what I just explained.<br><br>I know that I am not an expert and that I have many things to learn in order to be able to achieve these six principles in my classroom, that is why I must continue studying and keep myself updated with new strategies and learn from other teachers that can contribute to my currently formation as a teacher. At the same time, I must reflect on the feedback that other teachers may give me to make my practice better. In addition, I know that I might make mistakes and I must learn from them and use them as an opportunity to become a better teacher for my students.<br><br>Inside my principals I don’t mention evaluations and homework because I think they don’t need to be in the center of my classroom, they are not crucial for me. My goal is to see evaluations not as a thing that is stressful for my students and that every time, they have a test they must panic and have the best grades. Homework as well are not that important for me, I think that homework is only given when students are not able to finish something at school,&nbsp;but in general I believe students must not spend their afternoon doing extra work because they must be having a good time with their family and friends and disconnect their brains from school, because life is not only about learning but about being happy and living a life you will remember forever.<br><br>I want that when my students, present or future, walk into my classroom, consider it to be a place where they know they will learn, be loved, and create good relationships that will last forever, a place where they like to be, and I want them to remember me with the same love I give them. I will try to bring into the classroom these six important principles and all that I have learned during these five years at college.<br></p>
